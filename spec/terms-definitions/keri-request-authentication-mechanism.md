[[def: KERI Request Authentication Mechanism, KRAM]]

~ A non-interactive replay attack protection algorithm that uses a sliding window of date-time stamps and key state (similar to the tuple in [[ref: BADA-RUN]]) but the date-time is the replier’s not the querier’s. **KRAM is meant to protect a host**. See the [WebOfTrust glossary](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/keri-request-authentication-method) for more detail.
