[[def: autonomic identifier, AID, AIDs]]

~ A [[ref: self-certifying identifier]] (SCID) that is cryptographically bound cryptographically bound to a [[ref: key event log]] ([[ref: KEL]]), as defined by the [[ref: KERI specification]]. An AID is either non-transferable or transferable. A non-transferable AID does not support key rotation while a transferable AID supports key rotation using a key [[ref: pre-rotation]] mechanism that enables the AID to persist in spite of the evolution of its key state.
