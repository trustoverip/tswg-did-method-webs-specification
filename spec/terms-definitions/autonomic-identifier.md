[[def: autonomic-identifier, autonomic identifier, AID, AIDs]]

~ An [[ref: self-certifying identifier]] (SCID) that is cryptographically bound cryptographically bound to a [[xref: keri1, key-event-log, key event log]] (KEL), as defined by the [KERI specification](#KSWG-KERI). An AID is either non-transferable or transferable. A non-transferable AID does not support key rotation while a transferable AID supports key rotation using a key [[ref: pre-rotation]] mechanism that enables the AID to persist in spite of the evolution of its [[ref:key state]].
