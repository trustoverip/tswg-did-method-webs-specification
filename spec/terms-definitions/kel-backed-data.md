[[def: KEL-backed-data, KEL backed data]]

~ [[ref: KEL]] backed data in `did:webs` provides the highest level of data security assurance and such data can be found either in the KEL or anchored to an event in the KEL. This means that the signatures on the events in the KEL are strongly bound to the key state at the time the events are entered in the KEL, that is the data. 

~ Explanation: This provides strong guarantees of non-duplicity to any verifiers receiving a presentation as the KELs are protected and can be watched by agents ([[ref: watcher]]) of the verifiers. The information is end-verifiable and any evidence of duplicity in the events is evidence that the data or presentation should not be trusted.
